# ImageSimilarityChecker
This repo consist of the code to check the similarity of the images using the Dino model. I have deployed this for my personal use using ngrok. There are two html files which has two functions in it. 
### Function-1: This takes in an image and the name for the file. It then extract the features and store it separately. 
### Function-2: We take the similar looking images that we ahve in the dataset and upload it here. This function will compute the cosine similarity b/w the uploaded image feature and the previously stored feature and will return the name of the closest match.
